## Hobbies
When I'm not coding, you'll find me indulging in my hobbies:
- Watching Animes: I like to watch a variety of animes around the clock, but if you asked my favorite, I'd go for FMAB.
- Playing Games: I enjoy playing a lot of indie games, some of which aren't even made on a game engine. Just pure code, fascinating, isn't it?
- Exploring Design: In my free time, I like to browse Dribbble and explore different designs. Not only does this give me inspiration for my own designs, but it also keeps me updated on what's popular.
