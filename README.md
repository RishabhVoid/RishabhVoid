## Hobbies
When I'm not coding, you'll find me indulging in my hobbies:
- Watching Animes: I like to watch a variety of animes around the clock but if you asked my fav, I'd go for FMAB.
- Playing Games: I like to play a lot of indie games, some of them which aren't even made on a game engine. Just pure code, fasinating init?
- Exploring Design: In free time I like to go over dribble and just look at different designs. Not only this gives me inspiration for my own designs but also keeps me updated on what's popular
