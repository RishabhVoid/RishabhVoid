[Portfolio website](https://rishabhvoid.vercel.app/?view=about)

## About Me
Hello! A couple of years ago, I started making plugins for games I was playing and found out I loved the process of creating those plugins more than playing the games themselves. I enjoy designing UIs, building robots, and creating pieces of software, which led me to pursue a career as a developer. I am self-taught and have been learning for quite a while. I am proud to say that I can create entire full-stack applications independently. I am always open to collaborations and enjoy meeting people who work in this industry.

- Front-end technologies: ReactJs, NextJs, HTML, CSS, SASS, Styled-Components, TailwindCSS

## Hobbies
When I'm not coding, you'll find me indulging in my hobbies:
- Watching Animes: I like to watch a variety of animes around the clock, but if you asked my favorite, I'd go for FMAB.
- Playing Games: I enjoy playing a lot of indie games, some of which aren't even made on a game engine. Just pure code, fascinating, isn't it?
- Exploring Design: In my free time, I like to browse Dribbble and explore different designs. Not only does this give me inspiration for my own designs, but it also keeps me updated on what's popular.
